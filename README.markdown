cord
====
A `cord` is a sexy, styled JavaScript `String` that can print itself prettily.

This project was forked off of [percival][].

Currently, this involves intelligently handling ANSI escape codes for printing
styled strings to terminals; eventually, this should also print identically to
HTML source that can be injected into a document.
